# Fundamentals of Programming coursework

The coursework assignment for this module requires to work with a software project provided by the module staff and to complete a series of tasks outlined in this document. The tasks will ask you to complete several pieces of functionality to complete a basic 2D game.

The software provided to you is partially complete – the code to draw graphics to the screen and to handle input from a user are already working. You will complete methods in a specific class to build key parts of the game engine – the code will drive the rules of the game, deciding what is drawn and what happens when a user interacts with the system.

The software is fully documented and the methods that you need to complete are provided with both a task description in this document and documentation within the code describing what they should do. You must use what you have learned during the module to write the code to complete these methods. As you complete each task you should find the program grows more functional; each task when completed should produce some visible feedback (output to the screen) for you to test and assess.

The software is comprised of nine source files with nine classes. You should review each class, read the documentation for each class and understand how the software works before you start working. The modifications that you will make to the software are mostly limited to the GameEngine class, which you will see has a number of empty or partially complete methods for you to work on.
